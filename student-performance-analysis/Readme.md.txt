# Student Performance Data Analysis Using Excel & Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance data to identify academic patterns and insights using **Excel** and **Python**.  
The analysis focuses on understanding how age relates to marks, identifying top-performing students, and classifying students based on pass/fail criteria.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains student academic information with the following columns:

- **Sr No** – Serial number  
- **Name** – Student name  
- **Roll No** – Unique roll number  
- **Marks** – Marks obtained by the student  
- **Age** – Age of the student  

The dataset was prepared and stored in **Excel format** and later analyzed using Python.

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

###1️⃣ Average Marks by Age
- Grouped students by age
- Calculated the average marks for each age group
- Helped understand performance trends across different ages

### 2️⃣ Marks Distribution
- Visualized marks using a histogram
- Identified how marks are distributed among students

### 3️⃣ Top 10 Students
- Sorted students based on marks
- Extracted the top 10 highest-scoring students

### 4️⃣ Age vs Marks Correlation
- Calculated correlation between age and marks
- Visualized relationship using a scatter plot

### 5️⃣ Pass / Fail Classification
- Classified students as **Pass** or **Fail** based on marks
- Helped evaluate overall student performance levels

## 📊 Key Insights
- Certain age groups performed better on average  
- Most students scored within a specific marks range  
- Clear identification of top performers  
- Weak correlation between age and marks  
- Majority of students passed based on the defined criteria
